### Hi there :wave:

We’re excited that you’re using this project!

Please remember: this project is maintained by people volunteering their time, often alongside full-time jobs. While we’ll do our best to help, support here is **community-driven and provided as best-effort**. You are not entitled to free customer service.

### Help us, help you :bulb:

The more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to help:  
- Clarify whether your question is about a **concept** you don’t understand or a **problem** you’ve encountered
- Describe the **steps you took** and what you observed
- Avoid asking about your workaround instead of the actual problem (see the [XY Problem](https://mywiki.wooledge.org/XyProblem))
- Try the [rubber duck debugging method](https://rubberduckdebugging.com) before opening an [issue](../../../issues/new/choose)

### Thanks :raised_hands:
