# Contributing Guide

Thanks for considering a contribution to this project, we appreciate your time and ideas!

We aim to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible. Whether it's:
 * Reporting a bug
 * Discussing the current state of the code
 * Submitting a fix
 * Proposing new features
 * Becoming a maintainer

We use GitHub to host code, track issues/ feature requests, and review pull requests.

:point_right: First-time contributor? Don't worry, we'll guide you through it. Start by creating an [account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github).

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive, and harassment-free community.
Please review our [code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

## Reporting Bugs & Issues :bug:

:warning: Security issues must not be reported publicly, please follow our [security](.github/SECURITY.md) guidelines.

If you find a bug, open a new [issue](../../../issues/new/choose). A great bug report includes:
 * A quick summary or background information
 * Steps to reproduce, be specific and include sample code if possible
 * What you expected to happen
 * What actually happened
 * Any notes such as the possible causes, related issues, or attempted fixes

Before submitting:
 * Check our [issue backlog](../../../issues) to ensure it hasn't already been reported
 * If it has, please add a comment with extra context instead of opening a new issue

## Submitting Pull Requests :rocket:

We follow [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), pull requests (PRs) are the best way to propose changes.

Here's the process:  
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main` 
2. Ensure you follows our linting/style guidelines
3. If you've added code, include tests when possible and run the full test suite to ensure everything passes
4. If you've changed APIs, update relevant documentation
5. Open a pull request with a clear title and description

**Tips for Successful Contributions** :bulb:
 * Keep PRs focused and small, it's easier to review and merge
 * Write clear commit messages (e.g., fix: resolve null pointer issue in auth flow)
 * Be respectful and collaborative during code reviews
